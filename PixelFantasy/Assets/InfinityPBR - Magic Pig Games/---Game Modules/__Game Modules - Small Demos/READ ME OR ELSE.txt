READ ME BEFORE INSTALLING SMALL DEMOS!!!

** These demos have Game Module Objects and other scripts on them. For best results, please DO NOT IMPORT THEM INTO YOUR MAIN PROJECT **

Why? Because they have objects that you probably don't need in your main project.

Please install Game Modules 4 into a new empty project, and then open these .unitypackage files to install them. 

Check out any documentation and YouTube videos on them, experience the demo scenes, and dig into the code to see how things work. 

If you have any questions, please come to the Discord.

Thanks!
